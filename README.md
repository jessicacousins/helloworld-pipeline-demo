# Hello World CI/CD GitHub Actions & AWS S3 Bucket

## Description

This project is a HelloWorld app deployed on Amazon S3 Bucket using GitHub Actions. It demonstrates a basic CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline for a web application. When changes are pushed to the repository, the pipeline automatically builds and deploys the website to an S3 bucket. The webpage displays black text displaying "Hello World" and the background color will change each time the page loads.
